# odin-rock-paper-scissors
In this project, I am going to build a basic rock paper scissors game using Javascript. The game will receive user input (rock, paper, or scissors) and then output the result (win, lose, tie). 

This project is meant to be a practice of all the Javascript knowledge that I have acquired.
